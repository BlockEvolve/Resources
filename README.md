[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hFvQhMRnc4&authuser=0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hFvQhMRnc4&authuser=0)

**Bitcoin Supply**: Bitcoin supply is “controlled”. Currency in the Bitcoin system is created by nodes of a peer-to-peer network. The algorithm defines in advance how the currency will be created and at what rate making it “controlled”.

Block reward halving*:* The total value of “21 Million” matched a 4-year reward halving schedule where each block mined receives fewer rewards over time.

After all block rewards have been mined, miners will still receive transaction fees as incentive to keep mining to make transactions irreversible.

Theoretical Supply: 21 Million is the theoretical cap, but the total spendable supply will always be lower due to accidental loss (people forgetting their keys).

Bitcoin Demand: Bitcoin demand is not on a predictable schedule (see price inflation). A good way to see Bitcoin demand is to look at the intersection of its price chart (logarithm scale) and number of people using bitcoin.

What is a security? The [Securities Act of 1933](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitiesact1933.asp) and [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seact1934.asp) consider transactions (between buyer and seller) to be “investment contracts” (a security) if “a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the effort of the promoter or a third party.”

Recently, the SEC has ruled that Bitcoin and Ether are not securities.

Hardware wallet: Hardware wallets store a user’s private keys in a secure hardware device. Private keys are stored in a protected area of a microcontroller and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext.

Software wallet: Software wallets are online providers (i.e., [blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com/) or MyEtherWallet); they essentially store cryptocurrency as software files on a computer. They are convenient, but not as secure as hardware wallets.

Private keys: A private key in the context of Bitcoin is a secret number that allows bitcoins to be spent. Every Bitcoin wallet contains one or more private keys, which are saved in the wallet file. The private keys are mathematically related to all Bitcoin [addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address) generated for the wallet.

Cold storage: S[toring Bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Storing_bitcoins) offline and spending without the [private keys](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key) controlling them ever being online. This resists theft by hackers and malware, and is often a necessary security precaution especially dealing with large amounts of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Misconceptions

Not a viable currency: Bitcoin is a store of value and it can serve as a base for the other two pillars of currency – medium of exchange & unit of account.

Bitcoin has no intrinsic value: “Intrinsic” value is a misleading concept because people value things based on its usefulness for specific purposes. People value gold at over $10 trillion and bitcoin is similar, and often superior to gold because of it’s digital nature.

Volatile: It has been volatile and this is to be expected for a currency that has grown to hundreds of billions from 0 a decade ago. It’s useful to think of bitcoin as an emerging store of value. It’s likely that once bitcoin achieves more maturity (higher market cap) that volatility will decrease.

Bubble: A comparison is often made to the tulip bubble. Bitcoin has experienced four major cycles with 1000% upswing and 80% drawdown, each run starting at a higher price than the previous. This isn’t a one-time mania. Bitcoin is experiencing growth in both price and adoption.

Easy to hack: Being decentralized means Bitcoin is not prone to the usual hacks/attacks that happen to centralized services like exchanges.

Bad for the environment. Rebuttal: Bitcoin’s energy usage is required to do three things of value: 1. Fairly distribute new bitcoin (proof-of-work mining), 2. Allow anyone to participate in the network on even footing, 3. Create strong security assurances around bitcoin’s transaction settlement.

Bitcoin already consumes a significant amount of clean energy, and in the long-run there are plans to completely power bitcoin with renewable energy.

The Government Will Shut Bitcoin Down: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it impossible for anyone, even the government to “fully shut it down”.

One government imposing harsh regulations will only encourage other governments to embrace opportunities for attracting people looking to use bitcoin. Some [elected officials](https://casebitcoin.com/story/incoming-senator-discusses-bitcoin-as-store-of-value) have already adopted Bitcoin.

Mostly used by criminals: Early on there were more illicit activities linked to bitcoin (see now defunct Silk Road) and today, it remains very low.

This clear, concise, and accessible guide from two industry insiders shows you how to navigate this brave new blockchain world and how to invest in these emerging assets to secure your financial future.
  
[What is cryptocurrency](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/cryptocurrency) - A digital currency that is secured by [cryptography](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/cryptography)
 and is, typically, used as a medium of exchange within a [peer-to-peer (P2P)](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/peer-to-peer) digital economic system.

[What is Blockchain](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/blockchain) - In a few words, a [blockchain](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-does-blockchain-work) is a digital ever-growing list of data records. Such a list is comprised of many blocks of data, which are organized in chronological order and are linked and secured by cryptographic proofs.
  
What is Cryptography? Cryptography is a method of using advanced mathematical principles in storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended for, can read and process it.

“The word “**crypto**” literally means concealed or secret – in this context, anonymous. Depending upon the configuration, the implemented cryptography technology ensures pseudo- or full anonymity. In principle, the cryptography guarantees the security of the transactions and the participants, independence of operations from a central authority, and protection from [double spending](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublespending.asp).” ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/explaining-crypto-cryptocurrency/#:~:text=Cryptography%20is%20the%20mathematical%20and,the%20purpose%20of%20%22mining.%22))

Elliptical curve cryptography is what is used by Bitcoin for their encryption purposes.

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (part of Elliptical Curve cryptography) is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was the first public-key protocol conceived by Ralph Merkle (Merkle Trees), Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. This exchange underlies all transactions on Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Web 3.0*:* This was originally envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the Internet, as the “Semantic Web”, but it never came to fruition.

Instead, the blockchain movement is ushering a different vision of Web 3.0, but one that is spiritually aligned with what Berners-Lee envisions - “no permission is needed from a central authority to post anything…there is no central controlling node, and so no single point of failure…and no ‘kill switch’”.

Peer-to-Peer: Computing or networking is a [distributed application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_application) architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.

Note: This is the architecture of Bitcoin, Ethereum and essentially all “public blockchains”.

“User controlled internet”: Web3 is comprised of modular components that allows “state” to be preserved across all participants (all nodes in the network), while preventing vendor lock-in to layers underneath (i.e., today if you build on AWS, you’re locked-in to AWS’ ecosystem and it would be hard to switch to Google or another provider).

This means an application does not need to re-write its entire stack if it wants to change the state layer. Ultimately, this creates healthy competition and allows each layer to preserve the value that it creates without worrying about if the rules of the game get changed (i.e., kill switch, de-platforming etc).

Von Mises contribution was very simple, yet at the same time extremely profound: he pointed out that the whole economy is the result of what individuals do. Individuals act, choose, cooperate, compete, and trade with one another. In this way Mises explained how complex market phenomena develop.

[The Road to Serfdom](https://www.amazon.com/Road-Serfdom-Documents-Definitive-Collected/dp/0226320553/ref=sr_1_1?crid=20UA2SETL1N70&dchild=1&keywords=road+to+serfdom&qid=1614630964&s=books&sprefix=road+to+serf%2Cstripbooks%2C179&sr=1-1) by [F.A. Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek)

An unimpeachable classic work in political philosophy, intellectual and cultural history, and economics, *The Road to Serfdom* has inspired and infuriated politicians, scholars, and general readers for half a century. Originally published in 1944—when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin, and Albert Einstein subscribed lock, stock, and barrel to the socialist program—*The Road to Serfdom* was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

[The Origins of Money](https://www.amazon.com/Origins-Money-Carl-Menger/dp/1933550597/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+origins+of+money&qid=1614630704&s=books&sr=1-1) by [Carl Menger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Menger)

Written in the same year that he testified before the Currency Commission in Austria-Hungary, and published in English in 1892, Carl Menger explains that it is not government edicts that create money but instead the marketplace. Individuals decide what the most marketable good is for use as a medium of exchange.

[End the Fed](https://www.amazon.com/End-Fed-Ron-Paul-ebook/dp/B002N0ADQG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=end+the+fed&qid=1614630879&s=books&sr=1-1) by [Ron Paul](https://twitter.com/RonPaul?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)

In the post-meltdown world, it is irresponsible, ineffective, and ultimately useless to have a serious economic debate without considering and challenging the role of the Federal Reserve. In *End the Fed*, Ron Paul draws on American history, economics, and fascinating stories from his own long political life to argue that the Fed is both corrupt and unconstitutional.

[Money: Sound and Unsound](https://www.amazon.com/Money-Unsound-Joseph-T-Salerno/dp/1610166558/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=money+sound+and+unsound&qid=1614630741&s=books&sr=1-1) by [Joseph T Salerno](https://twitter.com/jtsale?lang=en)

Ludwig von Mises said that there can never be too much of a good theory. Salerno proves it in this sweeping and nearly comprehensive book on applied Austrian monetary theory. In Money: Sound and Unsound, Salerno uses the Misesian/Rothbardian theory of money to reinterpret historical episodes, reevaluate the history of thought, closely examine Federal Reserve policy, seek out cause and effect in business cycles, provide a new understanding of war and social unrest, and clarify the relationship between the state and the central bank.

[When Money Dies: The Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation, and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany](https://www.amazon.com/When-Money-Dies-Devaluation-Hyperinflation/dp/1586489941) by [Adam Fergusson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Fergusson_(MEP))

In 1923, with its currency effectively worthless (the exchange rate in December of that year was one dollar to 4,200,000,000,000 marks), the German republic was all but reduced to a barter economy. People watched helplessly as their life savings disappeared and their loved ones starved. Germany's finances descended into chaos, with severe social unrest in its wake. Money may no longer be physically printed and distributed in the voluminous quantities of 1923. However, "quantitative easing," that modern euphemism for surreptitious deficit financing in an electronic era, can no less become an assault on monetary discipline.

[The Dao of Capital: Austrian Investing in a Distorted World](https://www.amazon.com/Dao-Capital-Austrian-Investing-Distorted/dp/111834703X) by [Mark Spitznagel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Spitznagel)

In *The Dao of Capital*, hedge fund manager and tail-hedging pioneer Mark Spitznagel—with one of the top returns on capital of the financial crisis, as well as over a career—takes us on a gripping, circuitous journey from the Chicago trading pits, over the coniferous boreal forests and canonical strategists from Warring States China to Napoleonic Europe to burgeoning industrial America, to the great economic thinkers of late 19th century Austria. *The Dao of Capital* provides a rare and accessible look through the lens of one of today's great investors to discover a profound harmony with the market process—a harmony that is so essential today.

[Economics in One Lesson: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand Basic Economics](https://www.amazon.com/Economics-One-Lesson-Shortest-Understand-ebook/dp/B003XT60KO/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=economics+in+one+lesson&qid=1614629958&sr=8-1) by [Henry Hazlitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hazlitt)

Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of *The Freeman* magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote *Economics in One Lesson*, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.

[The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism](https://www.amazon.com/Machinery-Freedom-Guide-Radical-Capitalism-ebook/dp/B00LNDWWMW/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+machinery+of+freedom&qid=1614630555&s=books&sr=1-1) by [David D. Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Friedman)

The classic 1971 work of libertarianism by David D. Friedman, anarcho-capitalist, engagingly describes and celebrates a society based on individual private property rights and the right to consent to cooperative ventures free of coercion.

[Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://www.amazon.com/Debt-First-5-000-Years/dp/1612191290) by [David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber)

Anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom: he shows that before there was money, there was debt. For more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods – that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber arguest, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors.

[The Fiat Standard: The Debt Slavery Alternative to Human Civilization](https://saifedean.com/the-fiat-standard/) by [Saifedean Ammous](https://twitter.com/saifedean)

The Fiat Standard is Saifedean Ammous’s attempt to explain the technology behind the current analog global monetary system. Similar to how The Bitcoin Standard explained the functional essence of bitcoin and its potential social and economic implications, this book examines twentieth century monetary technology and explains its benefits and drawbacks, and its many modes of failure.

[The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and the Birth of the People's Economy](https://www.amazon.com/Deficit-Myth-Monetary-Peoples-Economy/dp/1541736184) by [Stephanie Kelton](https://twitter.com/StephanieKelton)

In this book, Stephanie Kelton lays out the case for Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), which says that monetarily sovereign countries like the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Canada, which spend, tax, and borrow in a fiat currency that they fully control, are not operationally constrained by revenues when it comes to federal government spending.

Charlie Munger famously said “I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do.” Well, if you are a bitcoiner, the modern monetary theorists are the “other side.”

[What are Dapps](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/) A decentralized application (Dapp) is an application built on a decentralized network that combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface. Read more about it here!

[Tokenomics](https://hackernoon.com/designing-a-token-economy-how-to-choose-an-economic-goal-224b2643576a) What is a Token Economy and How to Design a Thriving Cryptocurrency

[Why Web3 matters](https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/) Web3 offers a new way that combines the best aspects of the previous eras. It’s very early in this movement and a great time to get involved.
[What is Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) - Ethereum provides a way to make applications on the blockchain. Let’s understand what Ethereum is.

[What is DeFi](https://future.a16z.com/what-is-decentralized-finance/) - DeFi is the fourth wave, and it builds on a combination of these innovations. With DeFi, anyone in the world can lend, borrow, send, or trade blockchain-based assets using easily downloadable wallets without having to use a bank or broker. If they wish, they can explore even more advanced financial activities —  leveraged trading, structured products, synthetic assets, insurance underwriting, market-making —  while always retaining complete control over their assets.  
  
[DeFi Video Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17QRFlml4pA) - You might be searching the web trying to figure out "What is Defi?". Well, this video shows exactly what Defi (or decentralized finance) is and cover 5 main pillars holding it up, including examples to help illustrate our points - Stablecoins, Lending and Borrowing, Decentralized Exchanges, Insurance, Margin Trading
  
[A guide to Defi](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-finance-defi) - The core benefit of DeFi is easy access to financial services, especially for those who are isolated from the current financial system. Another potential advantage of DeFi is the modular framework it is built upon - [interoperable](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interoperability) DeFi applications on public blockchains will potentially create entirely new financial markets, products, and services. This article will provide an introductory dive into DeFi, its potential applications, promises, limitations, and more.
  
Ethereum: Ethereum is a decentralized, [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) featuring [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) functionality.

Ether (ETH) is the native [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) of the platform. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).

Open-source software: Open-source software (OSS) is a type of [computer software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software) in which [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) is released under a [license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license) in which the [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and [distribute the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_distribution) to anyone and for any purpose.

Open-source [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) may be developed in a [collaborative public manner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model). Open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration.

Smart contract: A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. [Smart](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/different-smart-contract-platforms/) **contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties.

Central Authorities: Traditionally we relied on central authorities to solve the problem of trust between peers.

The very concept of peer-to-peer implies circumventing a “central authority” (or middleman).

Decentralized Finance (DeFi): A form of finance that does not rely on central financial [intermediaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediary) such as [brokerages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokerage), [exchanges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_(organized_market)), or [banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank), and instead utilizes [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contracts) on [blockchains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain), the most common being [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum).

Decentralized Money: Bank-free methods of transferring wealth or ownership of any other commodity without needing a third party (or central authority).

Decentralized Lending: Cryptocurrency deposited on a lending platform that gets lent out to borrowers for an interest rate.

### Platform vs Protocols:

Platforms imply ownership by a corporation (i.e., Facebook, Twitter).

Protocols refer to things like HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol).

### Digital Assets:

Definition one: A digital asset is anything that exists in a digital format and comes with the right to use. Data that do not possess that right are not considered assets. Digital assets include but are not exclusive to: digital documents, audible content, motion picture, and other relevant digital data that are currently in circulation or are, or will be stored on digital appliances.

Definition two: Digital assets are claims on future network growth and tokens can pass through revenue, profit, user growth, rewards…A digital asset is the most flexible investment vehicle ever created.

Stablecoins: Cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility by being pegged to a stable asset or basket of assets. They can be pegged to fiat and other commodities (precious metals).

Prominent examples: Dai, Tether, USDC

Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC): The digital form of fiat money (regulated by a government, monetary authority or law), not to be confused with cryptocurrency from open-public blockchains.

Crypto Tokens: Units of value that organizations or projects can customize and develop on top of existing [blockchains](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/glossary#blockchain). Cryptocurrencies have their own blockchains.

The Bitcoin blockchain’s native currency is bitcoin, and the Ethereum blockchain’s native token is Ether — whereas tokens do not have their own blockchains.

Technology Stack: A set of tools, programming languages, technologies that work together to build software applications (websites, mobile apps, web apps etc).

Yield Farming: Also known as liquidity mining - a way to generate rewards with cryptocurrency holdings.

  <summary>DAO</summary>
  
[Everything about DAOs](https://future.a16z.com/dao-canon/) - What is (and isn’t) a DAO? Why do DAOs matter? How do DAOs fit into web3, crypto, the creator economy, future of work, and many other areas?

[Organization Legos: The State of DAO Tooling](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/organization-legos-the-state-of-dao-tooling-866b6879e93e) - Pioneers, builders, and some lucky individuals are living this future today. The projects mentioned in this article (and others) , are lowering barriers every day to make DAOs a viable path for the millions around the globe who are still excluded from opportunities afforded to a few.

[DAOs: Absorbing the Internet](https://www.readthegeneralist.com/briefing/dao#toc-3) - As more and more assets move on-chain, smart contracts and programmatic incentives will replace the legal system as a way to guarantee ownership. Similarly, DAOs will replace legal entities as the primary method of *coordination* around these assets. Rather than forming companies, individuals will instead create DAOs to manage on-chain assets.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): DAOs are best understood in the context of a traditional organization.

Traditional organizations have employment contracts that regulate an employee’s relationship with the organization. Rights and obligations are regulated by legal contracts and enforced by the legal system (within a Country’s legal environment).

Decentralized autonomous organizations involved people interacting according to self-enforcing open-source protocols. People performing tasks are rewarded with native network tokens. All stakeholders’ interests are aligned by consensus tied to the network tokens. People working with a DAO are not bound by a formal legal contract, but rather incentives tied to network tokens, and fully transparent rules written into the protocol.

DAOs vs centralized governance: As opposed to traditional companies that are structured in a top-down manner, with many layers of management and bureaucratic coordination, DAOs provide an operating system for people and institutions that do not know nor trust each other. These people might live in different geographical areas, speak different languages, and therefore be subject to different jurisdictions.

What is governance? Governance is “the process of interaction and decision-making among actors involved in a collective problem that lead to creation, reinforcement or reproduction of social norms and institutions”.

These questions continue to have extreme importance in the context of an open-source network (public blockchains), particularly since the work of the network is incentivized by native network tokens.

Fundraising and Regulation

What are ICOs (Initial Coin Offering)? An ICO is an alternative fundraising approach where anyone can invest in an open network protocol by holding the native cryptocurrency or tokens.

Traditionally, you have to be an accredited investor to invest in an IPO (initial public offering), where you own shares in a company.

“It's important to note that, unlike an [initial public offering](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/upside-downside-of-ipos.asp) (IPO), investing in an ICO won't result in you having an ownership stake of the company you're giving money to.” ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-ico/)).

What are NFTs (non-fungible tokens)?: A special type of cryptographic token that represents something unique.

They are not mutually interchangeable (non-fungible). Traditional example is a collective like a 1-of-1 Baseball Card or Sports Memorabilia. In the cryptocurrency context, the most famous example are Cryptokitties, which are digital collectible cats that are unique.

**[What is DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and How it Works](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-dao)**

  <summary>Glossary</summary>
  
[Glossary](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary) - Binance Academy's Glossary
  
Key Definitions:
  
**Bitcoin**

A type of digital currency in which a record of transactions is maintained and new units of currency are generated by the computational solution of mathematical problems, and which operates independently of a central bank.

***Note from Pomp*:** Decentralized digital currency. It is a distributed peer-to-peer finite digital currency that can be transferred instantly and securely between any two people in the world.

**Decentralization**

The transfer of control of an activity or organization to several local offices or authorities rather than one single one.

***Note from Pomp:*** Cryptocurrency falls along a spectrum between centralization and decentralization. The important aspects that can fall on the spectrum are: coin distribution/issuance, node count, network hash rate, node client implementation, social consensus, physical node distribution and software code contributors.

**Pseudonym**

A fictitious name, especially one used by an author.

**Anonymous**

A person not identified by name; of unknown name

**Pseudonym vs Anonymous**

***Note from Pomp**: Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym, but because their actual identity is unknown, they are anonymous*

**Distributed Ledger**

A digital system in which records of currency transactions (typically using bitcoin or similar cryptocurrencies) are simultaneously maintained at multiple points throughout a network

**Node**

A piece of equipment, such as a PC or peripheral, attached to a network.

**Network**

A number of interconnected computers, machines, or operations.

**Blockchain**

A system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.

***Note from Pomp**:* A type of distributed ledger where every node gets its own copy of the ledger. When a new transaction that gets added to the ledger – all copies of the ledger gets updated.

**Verifiable**

Able to be checked or demonstrated to be true, accurate, or justified.

**Audit**

An official inspection of an individual's or organization's accounts, typically by an independent body.

**Bitcoin’s Auditability (Verifiability)**:

***Note from Pomp:*** Bitcoin is a chain of digital signatures. Each transaction that gets added to the ledger is an owner transferring bitcoin to the next owner by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and public key of the next owner. Miners show proof-of-work for the opportunity to verify the transaction (transaction fees are the payment for doing this work).

Every node has a copy of the ledger – and public key cryptograph**y** allows a new owner to verify the chain of ownership and the state of the ledger (official ledger being the longest one). Because every node has a copy of the ledger, running a node allows you to verify the most updated ledger.

**Global Accessibility**

***Note from Pomp**:* Bitcoin requires no permission from a company, government or authority or other gate-keepers.

**Permission-less**

***Note from Pomp***: In a public blockchain, a user can create a personal address, and interact with the network to either help validate transactions or send transactions to another peer on the network.

**Price Inflation**

An increase in prices.

**Monetary Inflation**

An increase in money supply.

**Monetary Deflation**

A decrease in the money supply.

**Monetary Policy**

***Note from Pomp**:* In the U.S. the Federal Reserve determines the supply by buying/selling government bonds. Money is issued into the system as loans from the Federal Reserve to commercial banks, then from commercial banks to businesses/individuals. People generally rely on banks to be custodians of their money.

**Programmatic Monetary Policy**

***Note from Pomp***: One of bitcoin’s core guarantees is that money supply issuance is predictable ([bitcoin block reward halving](https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/)).

With Bitcoin, the supply is capped at 21 million with a predictable issuance schedule starting in 2009 to 2140 and is set by the Bitcoin protocol’s algorithm. Each computer is responsible for verifying transactions and ensuring that no double-spend happens.

Holders of bitcoin are their own custodians. Each individual is responsible for safely and privately storing their private keys which allows them to spend bitcoin in specific addresses. Private keys can be held on paper, in memory or on a hardware device. Individuals can hold their bitcoin on an exchange or third party custodian (bearing the risk that comes along with this). Transactions are address-to-address, peer-to-peer and are settled in 1-2 hours.

The price of goods in a BTC-denominated market is the CPI (consumer price index) divided by the BTC/USD exchange rate.

Bitcoin has a predictable money supply schedule, but **not** a predictable price. Potential confusion arises when you discuss with economists who originally used the term ‘inflation’ to refer to increases in the amount of money in circulation, but have more recently used ‘inflation’ to refer to rise in price level.

One of bitcoin’s core guarantees is that money supply issuance is predictable ([bitcoin block reward halving](https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/)).

**Store of Value**

The function of an asset is a store of value when it can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and expected to retain its value.

***Note from Pomp**:* Stores of Value become increasingly important in times of hyperinflation.

**Medium of Exchange**

Any item that is widely acceptable in exchange for goods and services.

**Unit of Account**

A measurement of the cost of goods and services.

***Note from Pomp**:* Inflation erodes a stable unit of account over time. Some people choose to use bitcoin as a store of value and medium of exchange, but NOT a unit of account. Ex: A boss pays a salary in the Bitcoin-equivalent of USD. Here, Bitcoin is a medium of exchange, but the unit of account is USD.

**Sound money**

Stable money, typically not liable to sudden appreciation or depreciation.

***Note from Pomp**:* Currency based on gold is often referred to as “sound money”. Many consider Bitcoin sound money due to its limited supply and decentralization.

**Portable**

Able to be easily carried or moved, especially because being of a lighter and smaller version than usual.

***Note from Pomp**:* Holders of bitcoin are their own custodians. Each individual is responsible for safely and privately storing their private keys which allows them to spend bitcoin in specific addresses. Private keys can be held on paper, in memory, or on a hardware device.

**Divisible**

Capable of being split into parts; separated.

***Note from Pomp**:* Bitcoin can be broken up into units as small as .00000001. The smallest value of Bitcoin is called a “Satoshi” (or “Sat”), named after Satoshi Nakamoto.

**Scarce**

Occurring in small numbers or quantities; rare***Note from Pomp**:* There will only ever be 21 million total Bitcoin.

**Double Spend Problem**

The risk that a person could concurrently send a single unit of a currency (Bitcoin) to two different sources via giving a copy to the recipient, while the owner retains the original.

***Note from Pomp**:* The Double Spend problem is unique to digital currencies because digital information can be reproduced easily. When the same Bitcoin is spent more than once; essentially digital files that are duplicated or falsified. The usual solution is a third-party, trusted intermediary.

**Censorship**

The suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.

**Censorship Resistant**

Nobody can block or intercept a transfer of any amount between nodes in the Bitcoin system.

  <summary>Adoption trends in countries</summary>
  
**Adoption Happens in Cohorts:**

1. Individuals
2. Organizations
3. Central Banks

Individuals: Bitcoin is often discovered randomly - through the internet, a friend, etc. Once people realize the fixed supply of Bitcoin, fiat money, and the implications, they HODL.

As more and more individuals adopt Bitcoin, pressure is put on organizations to adopt Bitcoin.

Organizations have just recently started to adopt Bitcoin.

Institutional Adoption: Until recently, institutions haven’t been involved in Bitcoin. ARK Invest and Fidelity were among the first. Most use Bitcoin as an inflationary hedge - see Michael Saylor’s “melting ice cube analogy”.

The general view is that ‘bitcoin’ is a safe-haven, institutional-grade investment that ‘institutional buyers’ want to put in their treasuries.

Out of all the big companies, Microstrategy appears to be the most public in their moves to acquire Bitcoin. They explicitly view Bitcoin as an asset to be integrated into the P&L as well as balance sheets.

Other corporations buying Bitcoin include: Tesla, Galaxy Digital Holdings, Square inc., Marathon Patent Group, and many more.

**Central Banks and Bitcoin:** Individual and institutional adoption puts pressure on Central Banks to create a Bitcoin strategy. Central Banks haven’t adopted Bitcoin yet, but the City of Miami is exploring putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet.

Countries have also banned Bitcoin - their attempts have been unsuccessful.

Buying Bitcoin directly vs Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC): GBTC is not the same as Bitcoin. GBTC is an investment trust or fund which buys Bitcoin on your behalf.

For mainstream investors who want exposure to Bitcoin without the technical know-how of accessing and securing Bitcoin, they could get exposure via GBTC.

### Taxes consequences: Taxable event on Bitcoin, according to the IRS are:

1. *Selling Bitcoins, mined personally, to a third party*
2. *Selling Bitcoins, bought from someone, to a third party*
3. *Using Bitcoins, which one may have mined, to buy goods or services*
4. *Using Bitcoins, bought from someone, to buy goods or services*

Bitcoin as property vs Bitcoin as currency: Bitcoin replicates fundamental pieces of property law, but does so outside of traditional legal structures. Bitcoin transactions have features that closely resemble grantor names, grantee names, legal descriptions, and signatures found in real property deeds.

There is no governing authority to coordinate transactions. Ownership is based on the protocol, computer records, community expectation and governance. Bitcoin functions as law, even though it operates outside of law.

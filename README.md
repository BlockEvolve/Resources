With blazing originality, *The Fourth Turning* illuminates the past, explains the present, and reimagines the future. Most remarkably, it offers an utterly persuasive prophecy about how America’s past will predict its future. *The Fourth Turning* offers bold predictions about how all of us can prepare, individually and collectively, for America’s next rendezvous with destiny.

[The Ethics of Money Production](https://www.amazon.com/Ethics-Money-Production-Guido-Hulsmann/dp/1610166817/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1FF6T32GCLBCW&dchild=1&keywords=the+ethics+of+money+production&qid=1614627757&sprefix=the+ethics+of+money+pro%2Caps%2C179&sr=8-1) by [Jorg Guido Hulsmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rg_Guido_H%C3%BClsmann)

This pioneering work, in hardback, by Jörg Guido Hülsmann, professor of economics at the University of Angers in France and the author of Mises: The Last Knight of Liberalism, is the first full study of a critically important issue today: the ethics of money production. This book hits the intellectual sweet spot, speaking to the issues that are driving economic events right now.

[What Has the Government Done to Our Money?](https://www.amazon.com/What-Has-Government-Done-Money/dp/1610166450/ref=sr_1_1?crid=26ZOK64T3R3N9&dchild=1&keywords=what+has+government+done+to+our+money&qid=1614630672&s=books&sprefix=what+has+governmen%2Cstripbooks%2C167&sr=1-1) by [Murray N. Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard)

Rothbard’s primer on money and government, originally published in 1963. After fifty years, it remains the best book in print on the topic, a real manifesto of sound money.

[The Mystery of Banking](https://www.amazon.com/Mystery-Banking-Murray-N-Rothbard/dp/1933550287/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+mystery+of+banking&qid=1614630845&s=books&sr=1-1) by [Murray N. Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard)

The Mystery of Banking is a great expert analysis of the modern fractional-reserve banking system and its origins-how it is unstable, how it exacerbates business cycles, and how it causes inflation. This book lays out the devastating effects of this most common form of banking on the lives of every man, woman, and child.

[The Theory of Money and Credit](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Money-Credit-Ludwig-Mises/dp/1620871610/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=theory+of+money+and+credit&qid=1614630040&s=books&sr=1-1) by [Ludwig Von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises)

Originally published in 1912, Ludwig von Mises’s *The Theory of Money and Credit* remains today one of economic theory’s most influential and controversial treatises. Von Mises’s examination into monetary theory changed forever the world of economic thought when he successfully integrated “macroeconomics” into “microeconomics” —previously deemed an impossible task —as well as offering explanations into the origin, value and future of money.

[Human Action: A Treatise on Economics](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Action-Ludwig-Von-Mises/dp/1614273545/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=human+action&qid=1614627609&sr=8-1) by [Ludwig Von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises)

Human Action: A Treatise on Economics" is the first comprehensive treatise on economics written by a leading member of the modern Austrian school of economics. Von Mises contribution was very simple, yet at the same time extremely profound: he pointed out that the whole economy is the result of what individuals do. Individuals act, choose, cooperate, compete, and trade with one another. In this way Mises explained how complex market phenomena develop.

[The Road to Serfdom](https://www.amazon.com/Road-Serfdom-Documents-Definitive-Collected/dp/0226320553/ref=sr_1_1?crid=20UA2SETL1N70&dchild=1&keywords=road+to+serfdom&qid=1614630964&s=books&sprefix=road+to+serf%2Cstripbooks%2C179&sr=1-1) by [F.A. Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek)

An unimpeachable classic work in political philosophy, intellectual and cultural history, and economics, *The Road to Serfdom* has inspired and infuriated politicians, scholars, and general readers for half a century. Originally published in 1944—when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin, and Albert Einstein subscribed lock, stock, and barrel to the socialist program—*The Road to Serfdom* was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

[The Origins of Money](https://www.amazon.com/Origins-Money-Carl-Menger/dp/1933550597/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+origins+of+money&qid=1614630704&s=books&sr=1-1) by [Carl Menger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Menger)

Written in the same year that he testified before the Currency Commission in Austria-Hungary, and published in English in 1892, Carl Menger explains that it is not government edicts that create money but instead the marketplace. Individuals decide what the most marketable good is for use as a medium of exchange.

[End the Fed](https://www.amazon.com/End-Fed-Ron-Paul-ebook/dp/B002N0ADQG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=end+the+fed&qid=1614630879&s=books&sr=1-1) by [Ron Paul](https://twitter.com/RonPaul?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)

In the post-meltdown world, it is irresponsible, ineffective, and ultimately useless to have a serious economic debate without considering and challenging the role of the Federal Reserve. In *End the Fed*, Ron Paul draws on American history, economics, and fascinating stories from his own long political life to argue that the Fed is both corrupt and unconstitutional.

[Money: Sound and Unsound](https://www.amazon.com/Money-Unsound-Joseph-T-Salerno/dp/1610166558/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=money+sound+and+unsound&qid=1614630741&s=books&sr=1-1) by [Joseph T Salerno](https://twitter.com/jtsale?lang=en)

Ludwig von Mises said that there can never be too much of a good theory. Salerno proves it in this sweeping and nearly comprehensive book on applied Austrian monetary theory. In Money: Sound and Unsound, Salerno uses the Misesian/Rothbardian theory of money to reinterpret historical episodes, reevaluate the history of thought, closely examine Federal Reserve policy, seek out cause and effect in business cycles, provide a new understanding of war and social unrest, and clarify the relationship between the state and the central bank.

[When Money Dies: The Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation, and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany](https://www.amazon.com/When-Money-Dies-Devaluation-Hyperinflation/dp/1586489941) by [Adam Fergusson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Fergusson_(MEP))

In 1923, with its currency effectively worthless (the exchange rate in December of that year was one dollar to 4,200,000,000,000 marks), the German republic was all but reduced to a barter economy. People watched helplessly as their life savings disappeared and their loved ones starved. Germany's finances descended into chaos, with severe social unrest in its wake. Money may no longer be physically printed and distributed in the voluminous quantities of 1923. However, "quantitative easing," that modern euphemism for surreptitious deficit financing in an electronic era, can no less become an assault on monetary discipline.

[The Dao of Capital: Austrian Investing in a Distorted World](https://www.amazon.com/Dao-Capital-Austrian-Investing-Distorted/dp/111834703X) by [Mark Spitznagel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Spitznagel)

In *The Dao of Capital*, hedge fund manager and tail-hedging pioneer Mark Spitznagel—with one of the top returns on capital of the financial crisis, as well as over a career—takes us on a gripping, circuitous journey from the Chicago trading pits, over the coniferous boreal forests and canonical strategists from Warring States China to Napoleonic Europe to burgeoning industrial America, to the great economic thinkers of late 19th century Austria. *The Dao of Capital* provides a rare and accessible look through the lens of one of today's great investors to discover a profound harmony with the market process—a harmony that is so essential today.

[Economics in One Lesson: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand Basic Economics](https://www.amazon.com/Economics-One-Lesson-Shortest-Understand-ebook/dp/B003XT60KO/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=economics+in+one+lesson&qid=1614629958&sr=8-1) by [Henry Hazlitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hazlitt)

Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of *The Freeman* magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote *Economics in One Lesson*, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.

[The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism](https://www.amazon.com/Machinery-Freedom-Guide-Radical-Capitalism-ebook/dp/B00LNDWWMW/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+machinery+of+freedom&qid=1614630555&s=books&sr=1-1) by [David D. Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Friedman)

The classic 1971 work of libertarianism by David D. Friedman, anarcho-capitalist, engagingly describes and celebrates a society based on individual private property rights and the right to consent to cooperative ventures free of coercion.

[Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://www.amazon.com/Debt-First-5-000-Years/dp/1612191290) by [David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber)

Anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom: he shows that before there was money, there was debt. For more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods – that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber arguest, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors.

[The Fiat Standard: The Debt Slavery Alternative to Human Civilization](https://saifedean.com/the-fiat-standard/) by [Saifedean Ammous](https://twitter.com/saifedean)

The Fiat Standard is Saifedean Ammous’s attempt to explain the technology behind the current analog global monetary system. Similar to how The Bitcoin Standard explained the functional essence of bitcoin and its potential social and economic implications, this book examines twentieth century monetary technology and explains its benefits and drawbacks, and its many modes of failure.

[The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and the Birth of the People's Economy](https://www.amazon.com/Deficit-Myth-Monetary-Peoples-Economy/dp/1541736184) by [Stephanie Kelton](https://twitter.com/StephanieKelton)

In this book, Stephanie Kelton lays out the case for Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), which says that monetarily sovereign countries like the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Canada, which spend, tax, and borrow in a fiat currency that they fully control, are not operationally constrained by revenues when it comes to federal government spending.

Charlie Munger famously said “I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do.” Well, if you are a bitcoiner, the modern monetary theorists are the “other side.”

This email course is really amazing. If you are someone who is interested in cryptocurrency but:

- Feel guilty that you might be too late to the game
- Don’t know where to start learning
- Lack the time and energy to sift through the hype and countless sources of information
- Don’t understand the complex jargon and technical lingo
- Feel lost trying to keep up with all the coins, projects, and Telegram groups
- Struggle to understand real-world uses and how crypto fits into the grand scheme of things
- Have been eagerly wanting to gain a strong foundational understanding from a trusted source
- Want to once and for all be able to tell the difference between what’s hype and what’s real
- Is looking for a place to ask questions without being judged for sounding dumb

This course is for you :)
